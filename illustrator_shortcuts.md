## All my favorite Illustrator shortcuts

Here's just a basic brain dump. I know I've definitely forgotten some good stuff. I'll update this based on your requests, or if I think of something useful.

### For selecting and resizing objects

*a* - Direct selection tool (for selecting nodes on polygons, or selecting single items within groups)
*v* - Selection tool (for selecting whole objects or groups)
*s* - Resize. Use mouse to drag outwards from center of object to size up, inwards to size down. Hold shift to keep resize proportional.

*cmd + g* - Group more than one object together
*cmd + shift + g* - Ungroup objects

### For drawing shapes

*m* - Draw a rectangle.
*l* - Draw an oval. Starts from top left "corner" of circle.
*\* - Draw a line.
*n* - Pencil. Freeform drawing.

*cmd + [* - Move object one closer to bottom of object stack 
*cmd + shift + [*  - Move object to the bottom of the object stack

*cmd + ]* - Move object one closer to top of object stack 
*cmd + shift + ]*  - Move object to the top of the object stack

*cmd + 7* - Create a clipping mask. The image you want to clip should be at the back, the object/shape you want to clip **to** should be on top (If clipping a group of objects instead of an image, those objects should be grouped with *cmd + g* first). Select both objects, then hit *cmd + 7*

### Text

*t* - Text tool
*t + click anywhere* - Start a line of text
*t + drag* - Draw a text box
*t + click on path* - Turn patch into line of text. Good if you need text around a circle or something. 

Don't confuse with *cmd + t* which toggles the sidebar

*cmd + shift + o* - For outlining text. Select a block of text and hit *cmd + shift + o* to convert text into outlines -- really good to do before shipping graphics in case anyone else doesn't have your fonts downloaded. Make sure to keep a copy of the un-outlined text off to the side before outlining text in case text needs revision.
